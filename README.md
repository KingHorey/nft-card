## Overview
Love a bit of cryptocurrency? This project is a nft card for a cyptocurrecy (Ethereum)

## My process
Before approaching this project I made the mistake of trying to do it as I did with others. But after encountering issues with certain aspects, I came across a Kevin Powell video and I approached this task with some of the tips he gave (Not that this entirely made it effortless) but it added more clarity
and as a result I was able to write HTML(less classes) and CSS (less styles) to the code and achieve beter results

## Built With
* Semantic HTML Markup
* CSS 

## What I learned
Making the image opaque and with a color on it was a headache, spent a few days trying to figure how that works.
However, to some degree I was able to make it work

## Continued development
Further designs will be aimed at:
* Making the card responsive
* Making sure the images are properly displayed (when hovered on) and others become opaque
